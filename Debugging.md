# Debugging Analysis of Harry Potter Adventure Game

Introduction

A thorough, JavaScript-based debugging investigation of the Adventure This work provides game material.

1. Breakpoint 1: The onset of the game line 9

The statement `debugger;` is found at the first line of the script.

Description:

* Execution was halted so as to check the initial configuration.
* The value of `currentState` should be `"start"`.
* Verify the correct link between DOM elements like `questionElement` and `answersElement`.

Forecasted Behavior::

* Shown is the first text of the query.
* There are no buttons at this moment to choose.

Observed conduct:

* `currentState` is set to `start`.
* The opening story's text is allocated to `questionElement.textContent`.
* 'answersElement.innerHTML' is empty.

Observation by Phase:

Adding response buttons should fill `answersElement`.

 Breakpoint 2: Following the Initial Option Selection (Line 62)

Inside the click event listener in the `addAnswerButton()` function is the location of the code.

Description:

* There is a pause when the user clicks the first option button.
Observe how the value of `currentState` advances to the following condition.

Forecasted Behavior:

* The value of `currentState` updates the following narrative node.
* Called and updating of the DOM happen via `renderQuestion()`.

Observed Action:

* nextState is currentState, for example, `pickWand`.
* The question wording updates as expected.
* New choice buttons appear.

**Step-Through Sighting:**

* Each choice changes the state appropriately, and the data is updated.

 Mid-Story/Second Choice Breakpoint 3 (Line 75)

Following the creating of fresh choices, the code's location is in the `renderQuestion()` function at the line: `debugger;`.

Specifications:

* Stopped for a break at the second deciding point.
* Be certain the branching logic is corrected properly.

Desired Behavior:

* The expected narrative route matches `currentState`.
* The alternatives match the right part of the story.

Observed Action:

* The expected mid-story state is reflected by `currentState`—for instance, `exploreCastle`.
* The options accessible match `story[currentState].choices`.

 Stepping Through Observing:

* The narrative path shifts in real time as the user makes choices.

End / Start at Breakpoint 4 (Line 100)

Inside the renderQuestion() function there is a debugger; statement if state.choices.length === 0.

Description

* Stopped at the end.
* The next button should be visible to restart the game.

Projected behavior:

* The ending of the narrative is displayed.
* Visible and interactive is the restart button.

NOTE:
I used the problem terminal for my code so thats why there is no issue.
