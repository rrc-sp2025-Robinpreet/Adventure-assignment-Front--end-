# Reflection - Hogwarts Adventure Game

What Went ?

I successfully implemented a branching story game set in the Harry Potter world. The JavaScript structure is clean and organized, using state management and functions. The CSS styling creates a magical Hogwarts feel while staying simple and readable.

Challenges:

The hardest part was  creativity (Harry Potter theme) with keeping the code simple enough to meet assignment standards. At first, I overcomplicated the CSS, but later I simplified it while still keeping the Hogwarts look. I used the emoji's instead.

What I Would Do Differently?

If I had more time, I would add images (like Hogwarts castle or wands) and maybe sound effects to make the game more immersive.

Learning:
I practiced DOM manipulation, event handling, and game state design. I also improved my ability to keep commits organized and meaningful, which will help in real software projects.
